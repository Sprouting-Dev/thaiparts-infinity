# AI Coding Instructions for ThaiParts Infinity (repository-aligned)

Concise, actionable guidance for AI coding agents working on this repository. These instructions assume the canonical flow used across the project (Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind + framer-motion + Strapi).

## High-level rules (must follow)

- Strapi-first: all page content and SEO come from Strapi. Use existing fetch helpers in `src/lib/cms.ts` and `src/services/*`. Do not add ad-hoc fetch logic in pages/components.
- Server components for data: perform Strapi fetches in server components or route handlers. Only create client components (`"use client"`) for UI interactivity; pass server-fetched data as props.
- Single source for metadata: use `buildMetadataFromSeo(seoObj, options)` from `src/lib/seo.ts` inside each page's `generateMetadata()` — do not invent alternative metadata builders.
- Safe HTML only: render CMS HTML with `src/components/SafeHtml.tsx` exclusively. Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` directly.
- Motion variants: import and reuse variants from `src/lib/motion.ts` rather than redefining them.
- Centralize shared logic under `src/lib/` (seo, sanitize, motion, image helpers). Reuse `src/services/*` helpers for Strapi endpoints and caching.

## Key file responsibilities (where to look first)

- `src/lib/seo.ts` — metadata builder. Typical usage:
  ```ts
  export async function generateMetadata() {
    const page = await fetchPageFromStrapi(); // via services helper
    return buildMetadataFromSeo(page.seo, {
      baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,
    });
  }
  ```
- `src/lib/cms.ts` & `src/services/*` — encapsulated Strapi fetch helpers (pages, articles, products). Use them to ensure consistent caching, population, and query params.
- `src/components/SafeHtml.tsx` — approved renderer for Strapi HTML. Always pass CMS HTML through it:
  ```tsx
  <SafeHtml html={article.content} />
  ```
- `src/lib/sanitize.ts` — sanitizer that preserves CKEditor newlines. Do not bypass.
- `src/lib/motion.ts` — shared framer-motion variants. Import like:
  ```ts
  import { fadeInUp } from 'src/lib/motion';
  ```

## Data fetching & caching

- Perform fetches in server components. Use service helpers which may set cache policies; prefer their defaults.
- If a component needs fresh client-side fetches, implement them in explicit client components and clearly document why client fetch is necessary.
- When pre-rendering metadata and content, keep SEO generation server-side via `generateMetadata()`.

## Client components and props

- Add `"use client"` at top for interactive components. Do not call Strapi from client files — receive data from server props.
- Keep client components small and purely UI-focused. Use prop drilling or context (only for UI state) rather than re-fetching.

## JSON-LD and script injection

- Emit server-side JSON-LD as a string child:
  ```tsx
  <script type="application/ld+json">{jsonLdString}</script>
  ```
- Do not use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for JSON-LD or CMS HTML — use SafeHtml for CMS HTML.

## Images and assets

- Use central image helpers in `src/lib` (if present) for constructing CDN URLs and sizes. Ensure next/image (if used) has consistent sizing and lazy loading.
- Prefer responsive sizes and consistent layout behavior across pages.

## Motion & animations

- Reuse variants from `src/lib/motion.ts`. Keep animation definitions small and consistent across components.

## Styling & accessibility

- Use Tailwind utility classes consistent with repo conventions. Favor composable class lists.
- Ensure semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for interactive widgets. Keyboard accessibility required for interactive controls.

## TypeScript & linting

- Keep types in sync with Strapi shapes (use existing types if present). Run type-checks and fix issues before committing.
- Run `npm run check` and `npm run fix` locally before raising PRs.

## Dev commands

- npm ci
- npm run dev
- npm run check # type-check + lint + format
- npm run fix # lint fix + format
- npm run build

## PR checklist

- Type-check passes
- Lint passes
- Formatting applied
- Manual sanity check of content & SEO on affected pages
- No direct use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (except SafeHtml wrapper)
- Use existing services/helpers for Strapi access
- Small, focused commits (Conventional Commits recommended)

## Troubleshooting notes

- If metadata looks wrong: confirm page `seo` payload shape from Strapi and feed it to `buildMetadataFromSeo`.
- If CMS HTML renders incorrectly on mobile: ensure `src/lib/sanitize.ts` is applied via SafeHtml.
- If animation behavior diverges across pages: check variants in `src/lib/motion.ts`.

- Suggest ways to improve developer experience (DX) and team efficiency.
- When reviewing: Give direct, constructive, actionable feedback with diffs/inline notes.
- Support multi-language answers (e.g. Thai/Eng), and can explain at multiple levels (beginner, mid, senior, CTO, exec).

**Your output:**

- Markdown formatted: clear headings, lists, code blocks, diagrams (PlantUML/mermaid if helpful), tables for pros/cons.
- If not enough detail, always ask for more context (target user, team, stack, infra, etc).
- Can summarize for managers or deep-dive for devs as needed.
- Never say “as an AI model” — speak like a real world-class tech lead.
- Always recommend further reading/resources for learning or reference.

**Whenever a task is given, you must:**

1. Clarify use-case, target user, business goal, constraints.
2. Confirm level of detail needed (beginner, advanced, exec).
3. Identify runtime, stack, and team/infra context.
4. If info is missing, always ask for it.
5. For any code/task, provide rationale, alternatives, and production tips.

You exist to help build, scale, and evolve world-class, real-world software, products, and teams — faster, safer, and smarter than any human.
